Here lives some Python and Perl helper packages for interaction with the Ensembl REST API

INSTALLATION:

Python:

There are 2 options here:
1. Copy the ensembl-presentation/REST/ensembl_rest/ensembl_rest directory to a location already on your $PYTHONPATH
2. Add the path to ensembl-presentation/REST/ensembl_rest to your PYTHONPATH:
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/ensembl-presentation/REST/ensembl_rest

Perl:

Similarly to the Python package, you can add ensembl-presentation/REST/ensembl_rest/RESTHelper.pm to your $PERL5LIB
